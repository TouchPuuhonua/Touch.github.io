    <h1>Health Breakthrough 2005</h1>

    <p>
      Starting in July 2005 I made a few simple changes in my diet
      and by the end of the year I had
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Lost 50 pounds </li>
      <li> Improved my mental focus, acuity and stamina </li>
      <li> Improved my physical strength, agility and stamina </li>
    </ul>
    <p> My weight is now what I consider to be my ideal
      weight, the same as it was in my 20's, and my body holds this
      ideal weight even when I deviate from the program for a few
      weeks.  It is once again my "set-point."
    </p>
    <p>
      I now have at least the mental ability I had in my 20's: I have
      my mental focus, acuity and stamina back, plus all of the
      experience I've gained over the years.  For me, this is the important
      breakthrough.
    </p>
    <p>
      My purpose here is to document the changes I made in case they
      are also effective for others &mdash; perhaps you!
    </p>

    <h2> Some background on me before the breakthrough </h2>

    <ul>
    <li>
	I don't smoke or drink &mdash; never have.
      </li>
      <li>
	I don't drink sodas or other sugary drinks &mdash;
	fortunately, I've never liked them.
      </li>
      <li>
	For many years I've eaten a fairly low-fat diet, close to the
	recommendations of conventional nutritionists.
      </li>
      <li>
	I've always gotten moderate exercise; although not always as
	much as is recommended &mdash; I've never been a "couch potato".
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>    
      Despite all of these fairly good things, my weight began to
      increase from age 29 on, at approximately 1 3/4 pounds a year.
      Nothing seemed to make much difference:
    </p>
    <p>
      In my youth I was considered a prodigy in physics, mathematics
      and computer science.  These skills take great mental focus and
      my ability to do this kind of work had been gradually declining
      over the years.  In my 20's I could work with complex
      abstractions for 10 or more hours a day, 6 days a week.  By a
      year ago, I was lucky if I could get 6 hours of really good work
      in a week.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	When I dropped most fat from my diet I continued to gain weight at
	about the same rate.
      </li>
      <li>
	When I increased my exercise program I noticed that some of my fat
	changed to muscle and I continued the gradual weight gain.
      </li>
      <li>
	During a long trip to India I lost 30 pounds due to getting sick
	several times.  Once I was back, my body quickly caught up the
	weight and I was right back on the same curve.  Apparently the
	change had not affected my "set-point".
      </li>
      <li>
	Although harder to quantify, none of the changes I tried
	seemed to affect my gradual mental decline.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I had been aware for some time that health and longevity could
      likely be increased through a diet with good nutrition but
      restricted calories.  However, any time I even thought about
      restricting calories I was inspired to head for the refrigerator
      and have something extra to eat!  Dieting, in the sense of
      eating less than I want to eat, has never seemed to be something I
      could do.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I was in my 20's I would generally eat much more than I have
      since, but I would also easily forget about eating when I was
      busy.  I always loved rice, pasta and fish.  I generally disliked
      fatty foods.  I got lots of exercise, generally bicycling,
      walking and swimming and I never gained weight.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my 40's I found myself usually having a large serving of rice
      at dinner time and having an extra small meal a few hours after
      dinner &mdash; but then I have always tended to work late, sleep
      late and skip breakfast, so I was actually having three fairly
      regular meals a day.
    </p>
    
    <h2> The inspiration for the change </h2>

    <p>
      I have long had a great deal of respect for the scientist <a
	href="http://singularity.com/aboutray.html"> Ray Kurzweil</a>.  In
      early 2005 a friend asked if I'd read Ray's book <a
	href="http://www.fantastic-voyage.net/">Fantastic Voyage : Live
	Long Enough to Live Forever</a>, co-written by Ray and Terry
      Grossman.  Although I was not aware of Ray Kurzweil as an
      authority on health and longevity, I was intrigued enough to order
      a copy and start reading.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ray and Terry, as they refer to themselves, are interested in
      living "forever" by living into the coming era a few decades
      from now when they expect technology will be able to begin to
      slow and eventually reverse aging.  This is a passion with
      them, they are scientifically literate researcherrs and they've
      put together a highly optimal program.  In fact, it is an
      exacting and intense program, but it is what they calculate
      will give them the best chance of "living long enough to live
      forever."
    </p>

    <p>
      One thing in the book bothered me: their (probably Ray's) "gee
      whiz" scenarios of the future.  For example, how in the future
      we'll be able to get optimal nutrition through nanobots, rather
      than the food we eat.  I found their futuristic projections
      embarrassing, with a crude 1950's flavor.  It is not that their
      projections are too far-out, but rather the opposite: I expect
      the future to offer much more sophisticated and desirable
      options.  But then, I'm of a later generation and my values
      and expectations are different than theirs.  Fortunately, Ray
      and Terry's futuristic scenarios are irrelevant to their health
      and longevity program, outside of the motivating effect they may
      have on some people.  If you can't relate to them, simply ignore
      them as I try to.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe that Ray and Terry's program is equally valuable
      whether or not you're interested in the possibility of living
      "forever".  After all, the first rule of living a long life is to
      live each day (and each moment) fully.  Good health and slow
      aging is of interest to everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can get a good overview of what Ray and Terry recommend at
      <a href="http://fantastic-voyage.net/ShortGuide.htm">
        http://fantastic-voyage.net/ShortGuide.htm</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Although their book outlines a very intensive program, Ray and Terry
      caution against making big changes quickly.  Looking at their
      various recommendations, I adopted two which I thought would
      be fairly easy:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
	Moderately reducing carbohydrates.
      </li>
      <li>
	Taking a few good supplements.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3> Reducing carbohydrates </h3>

    <p>
      I didn't realize how quickly starches in grains like wheat and
      rice and root vegetables like potatoes are converted to sugar in
      the intestines.  It happens quickly after a meal.  Sugar pours
      into the bloodstream and the pancreas responds with insulin to
      compensate.  Regular large floods of insulin promote insulin
      resistance in our cells, leading to a craving for more
      carbohydrates and you have a classic vicious cycle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ray and Terry do not recommend the super-low carbohydrate
      and generally unhealthy Atkins diet.  However, Ray and Terry recommend
      keeping carbohydrates fairly low.  They claimed that if I gave up
      major starches, I'd stop craving them in a few weeks and
      wouldn't miss them.  I didn't believe it, but I tried it.  And
      it worked like a charm.  I give some details below of the diet I
      now follow.
    </p>

    <h3> Taking supplements </h3>
    <p>
      Many people say that taking supplements should be unnecessary if
      one has a good diet, and perhaps is an undesirable distraction
      from concentrating on getting a healthy diet.  This is probably
      true for young people and people with good genes.  As they age,
      most people's bodies stop doing an ideal job with metabolic
      processing.  Sophisticated tests are beginning to be able to
      measure defects in metabolism as well as the genes which
      predispose us to such problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      In many cases, supplements can supply the support which an aging
      body needs to function properly.  The metabolic deficits are
      covered by the presence of extra key ingredients, precursors,
      etc.  Ray and Terry recommend a number of supplements, and they
      take <em>lots</em> of them.  I'll give some details of what I
      take below.
    </p>

    <h2> What I did that works for me </h2>

    <h3> <a href="http://www.rayandterry.com">Ray and Terry's Longevity Products</a> </h3>

    <p>
      I needed to make easy changes, especially at first, since
      after all, I wasn't really expecting much at the beginning.  (I
      was actually expecting nothing, but I was willing to give it a
      try.)
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the things which interested me and also repelled me was
      that Ray and Terry set up a company to provide nutritional
      products aligned with their book.  With all of the unscrupulous
      marketing of product tie-ins in our economy, this sort of thing
      puts me on guard.  But the products looked useful.  Fortunately,
      I have two friends who are nutrition experts and I asked them to
      evaluate Ray and Terry's products.  My friends gave the products
      high marks, so I ordered three of them:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Chocolate Meal Replacement Shake </li>
      <li> Total Care Daily Formula </li>
      <li> Immune Formula </li>
      <li> EPA/DHA Essential Fatty Acids </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note from 2020: These 2005 products have changed and similar products are now available form other sources.  I've revised and chantged my supplements quite a bit since 2005!</p>

    <h3> My new diet </h3>

    <p>
      The Meal Replacement Shake is basically a high-protein, low-carbohydrate
      and low-fat alternative to skipping meals.  Instead of skipping
      breakfast, if I don't feel like making a proper breakfast I have
      the MRS.  I think that this one change has made a huge
      difference.  I probably have Ray and Terry's meal replacement
      shake for breakfast five days a week.  Sometimes I add a
      double-espresso!  Once in a while I'll have
      it as a replacement for another meal I would otherwise miss.  It
      is sweetened with Stevia, about which more later.  And now it
      comes in three flavors although I prefer the "chocolate" (really
      cocoa).
    </p>

    <p>
      At dinner we no longer have a major starch component.  No bread,
      pasta, rice, corn or potatoes.  Instead, we have four or more non-starchy vegetables, as
      separate dishes or in some combination.  We try to include at
      least one vegetable from each of the  following families at each
      meal:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Cruciferous family: Cabbage, kale, broccoli, cauliflower,
	brussels spouts, Chinese broccoli, bok choy, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
	Legume family: Peas, lentils, beans, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
	Leafy greens: Spinach, mustard greens, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
	Orange vegetables: Yams or sweat potatoes in moderation (they
	are less starchy and more nutritious than white potatoes) and
	squash (spagetti squash makes a <em>great</em> alternative
	pasta).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We don't always hit all of these kinds of vegetables, and we
      often include others like artichokes, asparagus, eggplant, etc.
      </p>
    <p>
      We eat fish several times a week, preferring the fish which are
      high in Omega-3 fatty acids.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are not vegetarians, although vegetables are now the largest
      component of our diet.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we cook (most nights), we are careful to make extra, so
      that there will always be plenty of healthy things for lunch and
      snacks in the refrigerator.  Sometimes we bring home healthy
      things like Thai food (but no rice), and again, we make sure
      there's plenty.
    <p>
      I still drink coffee, but less than before, one or sometimes two
      double lattes or espressos a day instead of the two or three I
      drank before.  I've increased my tea consumption, including
      green tea.  I've also gotten very fond of cocoa.  These things
      are very satisfying alternatives to unhealthy snacks and are
      great pick-me-ups when my energy is low.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the cocoa, I mix two scoops of Droste's excellent
      unsweetened cocoa into water or lowfat milk or unsweetened soy
      milk and add a tiny amount of stevia.  Stevia is a healthy
      alternative sweetener which works very well as long as you don't
      overdo it.  It is 32 times sweeter than sugar but has an
      off-taste if overdone.  So I undersweeten, leaving the cocoa
      slightly bitter, which I prefer.  If often add vanilla and/or
      cinnamon.  Yum!
    </p>

    <h3> The supplements I take </h3>

    <p> In addition to the three Ray and Terry's supplements mentioned
      above, I also take:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pregnenolone, 15 mg.</li>
      <li> Time release Ester C, 500 mg. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I take each of these five pills twice a day, in the morning and
      at night.
    </p>
    
    <p>Pregnenolone is a precursor to a number of essential steroid
      hormones.  I get it at the local "health-food" store.
    </p>
    <p>
      I get the time-release Ester C at <em>Trader Joe's</em>, another
      local store which is also a chain.  I've found that it helps me
      avoid picking up colds after long airplane flights, so I've been
      taking it for many years.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just recently I've added a few more Ray and Terry supplements -
      they've really expanded their line in recent months.  However,
      the ones I've mentioned above are the ones I took during the
      time I've had the health breakthrough.  Whether the additional
      ones I'm taking will provide additional benefit remains to be
      seen.  With all supplements, the benefit is a function of one's
      individual metabolic situation.  I figure that some of the
      supplements I'm taking are very beneficial and most of them just
      make for expensive bright yellow pee!  Until sophisticated tests
      make it easy and inexpensive to know what I really need, I'm
      going to take a fairly broad set of supplements on general
      principles.
    </p>
    
    <h3> My exercise program </h3>

    <p>
      One of the benefits of my health breakthrough is that I have
      more strength, stamina and vitality than I did a year ago.  I
      feel more like exercising.  My wife and I joined the local YMCA
      about a year ago, and after our health started picking up we
      increased our exercise regime.
    </p>

    <p>
      Starting about half-way through the breakthrough period and
      continuing to this day, we work out 3-6 days a week.  We do
      weights 2-3 days a week for about 45 minutes, swim 1-2 days a
      week for about 30 minutes and do yoga 2-3 times a week.
      Sometimes we take a walk or a dance class instead.  I've never
      before maintained such a good exercise practice.  I'm guessing
      it has improved the health benefits I've gotten.
    </p>

    <h2> How it's worked for my wife and housemates </h2>

    <p>
      I live with my wife Sher and two friends, Cat and Bill.  All
      four of us have read the book.  Bill does most of our cooking
      (he's really good), but all of us have some cooking ability.
      Only Sher and I have
      significantly reduced carbohydrates.  All of us have been
      experiencing improved health, but only Sher and I have lost
      significant weight and gotten a reduced set point.  Sher has lost 60
      pounds!  Sher does not tolerate milk or the less fermented soy
      products, whereas both work well for me.  Unfortunately for her,
      the meal replacement shake contains soy protein so Sher
      hasn't felt like braving it.  Her alternative is to eat fruit
      for breakfast, which somehow works for her.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also started out with a household agreement to not eat
      between dinner and breakfast.  I wound up breaking that
      agreement as my weight got closer to my ideal.  Sher modified
      the agreement to allow fruit after-hours if she's hungry.
    </p>

    <p>
      I want to emphasize that the weight loss has been effortless in
      my case, and fairly easy in Sher's case.  We aren't totally
      strict with carbohydrates: if we're at a party, we eat what is
      there.  I eat a lot of chocolate - probably several pieces of
      dark chocolate a day.  We also eat several pieces of fruit a
      day, much more than we used to and I think that this is a good
      use of our carbohydrate "budget" (we're not actually counting
      them).  Our appetites are lower and we are more easily satisfied
      than before.  We are not exercising greater "will power" &mdash;
      in fact, I'm certain I'm not exercising any!
    </p>

    <p>
      All four of us are finding our way into practices that we like
      <em>more</em> than the old practices.  We're eating delicious
      foods in quantities which are satisfying.  Dinners are better.
      We're doing forms of exercise we enjoy, again in desired
      quantity.  It's key that we're doing this as a household: Our
      shopping, stocking and cooking are consistent.  We eat very
      little processed foods.  We are eating in restaurants less, and
      we've learned how to ask for healthy modifications of restaurant
      meals which are just as satisfying.  Sher and Bill and I support
      each other in heading out for exercise: I always enjoy it once
      we're there, but I wouldn't go very often without the support.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Finally, please note that what I say here about Ray and
        Terry's book and their recommendations is a gross
        simplification of their research and their program.  What we
        do is working very well for us, but then we've picked out the
        pieces of their program which fit our needs.  Your might find
        that a somewhat different subset of their program works best
        for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      My we all live long and healthy lives!
