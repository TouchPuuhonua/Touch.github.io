    <p>
	    This classic book expands understanding of the evolution and
	    nature of life by looking at it all from the "viewpoint" of
	    genes.  This is also the book where Dawkins proposes the idea
	    of <em>memes</em>, the gene-like elements of culture.

	    This short and beautiful book explores the aspect of the
	    evolution of genes within the context of the other genes they
	    must cooperate with because they keep winding up sharing the same
	    bodies.  Another mind expanding trip.

	    Rationalism and evolutionary biology (as if there's any other
	    kind).  A brilliant collection of short pieces: essays,
	    forwards, reviews and eulogies.  Insightful and delightful.

	<h4>Stephen Pinker</h4>

	<h2>Hard Science Fiction</h2>
	<p>
	  Hard Science Fiction is that sub-genre of Science Fiction which
	  uses known or possible science in interesting ways to create the
	  story.  As Stephen Hawking said:
	  <em>
	    Itâ€™s really the only fiction that is realistic about our true
	    position in the universe as a whole.
	  </em>
	</p>
	<h3>Favorite Authors</h3>
	<h4> Greg Bear </h4>
	<p>
	  Especially <em class="BookTitle"> Blood Music </em> and <em class="BookTitle"> Moving Mars </em>.
	</p>
	<h4> Corey Doctorow </h4>
	<p>
	  Read everything, but especially <em class="BookTitle"> Little Brother </em>.
	</p>
	<h4> Robert Forward </h4>
	<p>
	  Forward is not the best writer, but his ideas are so delightful!
	</p>
	<h4> Charles Sheffield </h4>
	<h4> Neil Stephenson </h4>
	<p>
	  Especially <em class="BookTitle"> Diamond Age </em> and <em class="BookTitle"> Snow Crash</em>.
	</p>
	<h4> John Varley </h4>
	<p>
	  An extraordinary stylist.  I especially like his short stories,
	  which are always out of print because publishers never print
	  enough.  The collections of his stories are <em class="BookTitle">The Persistence
	  of Vision</em>, <em class="BookTitle"> Picnic on Nearside </em> and <em class="BookTitle">Blue
	  Champagne</em>.  If you can find 'em, buy 'em, otherwise borrow 'em.
	  Read everything else he's written too!
	</p>
	<h4> Vernor Vinge </h4>
	<p>
	  Vernor Vinge is God.  I read everything he writes and can't
	  believe how good it is.
	</p>
	<h2>Soft Science Fiction</h2>
	<h3>Favorite Authors</h3>
	<h4> Ursula Le Guin </h4>
	<p> Especially <em class="BookTitle"> The Left Hand of Darkness </em> and <em class="BookTitle"> The
	    Dispossessed </em>.
	</p>
	<h4> Theodore Sturgeon </h4>
	<p> Especially his short stories and the two novels <em class="BookTitle"> Venus
	    Plus X </em> and <em class="BookTitle"> Godbody</em>
	</p>
