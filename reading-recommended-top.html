    <h3>Entry-Level Science and Philosophy</h3>
		<h4>Favorite Authors </h4>
		<h5><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Richard_dawkins" target="_blank">Richard Dawkins</a></h5>
		<p>
			Good ones to start with are the seminal <em class="BookTitle">The Selfish Gene</em>
			and the little gem <em class="BookTitle">River out of Eden</em>.
		</p>
		<h5><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Daniel_Dennett" target="_blank">Daniel Dennett</a></h5>
		<p>
			Dennett is in my opinion the greatest living philosopher.  My
			favorites are <em class="BookTitle">Consciousness
				Explained</em>, <em class="BookTitle">Darwin's Dangerous
				Idea</em> and the collection 
			<em class="BookTitle">The Mind's Eye</em> which he and
			Douglas Hofstadter edited and contributed to.
		</p>
		<h5><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Jared_Diamond" target="_blank">Jared Diamond</a></h5>
		<p>
			If you still haven't read <em class="BookTitle">Gun's Germs and
				Steel</em>, get right at it!  Also highly
			recommend <em class="BookTitle">The Third Chimpanzee</em>
			which is, of course, us!
		</p>
		<h5><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Roger_penrose" target="_blank">Roger Penrose</a></h5>
		<p>
			One of the greatest living physicists with an extraordinary
			gift for writing.  If you really want to understand modern
			physics, I recommend <em class="BookTitle">The Road to
				Reality</em>, but it's hard work.  There's also
			the somewhat easier <em class="BookTitle">The Emperor's New
				Mind</em> which brilliantly explains much of
			modern science and mathematics in order to then be able to
			present his radical but unlikely hypothesis of how the human
			mind works.  For physics read Penrose, for the mind read
			Pinker and Dennett!
		</p>
		<h5><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Steven_Pinker" target="_blank">Stephen Pinker</a></h5>
		<p>
			His book <em class="BookTitle">The Language Instinct</em> is the
			best single book on the nature of human language
			and <em class="BookTitle">How the Mind Works</em> does an extraordinary
			job of covering the current scientific framework for understanding the mind.
			He has followed up the themes in each of these two foundational books
			with sequels and then turned them into two "trilogies" by bringing their
			themes together in <em class="BookTitle">The Stuff of Thought</em>.
		</p>
		
		<h2 id="fiction"> Fiction </h2>
		<p>
			<em>Speculative Fiction</em> is Fiction in which the
			author has changed some of the rules of how the world or
			even the universe work.  Sometimes this is done to provide
			an alternative background designed to bring out important
			insights in logic, human psychology or sociology, or other
			possibilities which would be harder to see in a familiar
			context.  Good <em>Speculative Fiction</em> is not idle
			fantasy, it is intended to make the reader think and come
			to important new understandings, often of themselves.  All
			of the fiction below is <em>Speculative Fiction</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Science Fiction is that sub-genre of Speculative Fiction which
			uses known or possible science in interesting ways to create the
			story.  As Stephen Hawking said:
			<em>
				Itâ€™s really the only fiction that is realistic about our true
				position in the universe as a whole.
			</em>
			Most of the fiction below is <em>Science Fiction</em>,
			some exploring the <em>Hard Sciences</em> (Physics,
			Chemistry, Biology) and some exploring the <em>Soft
				Sciences</em> (Psychology, Sociology).  In both cases the
			fiction has to be consistent with known science at the
			time of writing, although it can extend what is known
			with conjecture.  A few of the works below are <em>Hard
				Fantasy</em>, i.e. <em>Speculative Fiction</em> which is
			NOT consistent with known science, often taking places in
			an alternative universe.  The departures can be profound,
			but they must be internally consistent.

		<h4>Favorite Authors</h4>
		<h5> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Bear"  target="_blank">Greg Bear</a> </h5>
		<p>
			My favorites are <em class="BookTitle"> Blood Music</em>
			and <em class="BookTitle"> Moving Mars</em>.
		</p>
		<h5> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow" target="_blank">Cory Doctorow</a> </h5>
		<p>
			All of Cory's books are available free on the Web.  I've bought
			physical copies of my favorites for the pleasure of lending and
			re-reading.  If you want a really great fast read, check
			out <em class="BookTitle"> Little Brother</em>.
		</p>
		<h5> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Forward" target="_blank">Robert Forward</a> </h5>
		<p>
			Forward may not be a great writer in terms of literary quality
			but his ideas are extraordinary.  If you like
			super-hard SF you'll love him!
		</p>
		<h5> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sheffield" target="_blank">Charles Sheffield</a> </h5>
		<p>
			Too many favorites to choose from!
		</p>
		<h5> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Stephenson" target="_blank">Neil Stephenson</a> </h5>
		<p>
			My favorites are <em class="BookTitle"> Diamond Age</em>
			and <em class="BookTitle"> Snow Crash</em> but I love all of his work!
		</p>
		<h5> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stross" target="_blank">Charles Stross</a> </h5>
		<p>
			An extraordinary and diverse writer! I particularly
			like <em class="BookTitle"> Singularity Sky</em>
			and <em class="BookTitle"> Accelerando</em> which is available
			as a free download.  I can't believe how much I'm liking his
			geeky, Lovecraftian "Laundry" stories, beginning with
			<em class="BookTitle">The Atrocity Archives</em>.
		</p>
		<h5> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Varley_%28author%29" target="_blank">John Varley</a> </h5>
		<p>
			An extraordinary stylist.  I especially like his short stories,
			which are always out of print because publishers never print
			enough.  The collections of his stories are <em class="BookTitle">The
				Persistence of Vision</em>, <em class="BookTitle"> Picnic on
				Nearside</em> and <em class="BookTitle">Blue
				Champagne</em>.  If you can find 'em, buy 'em;
			otherwise borrow 'em.
		</p>
		<h5> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_Vinge" target="_blank">Vernor Vinge</a> </h5>
		<p>
			Vernor Vinge is God.  I read everything he writes and can't
			believe how good it all is.
		</p>
		<h5> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_Le_Guin" target="_blank">Ursula Le Guin</a> </h5>
		<p>
			Especially <em class="BookTitle"> The Left Hand of
				Darkness</em> and <em class="BookTitle">The
				Dispossessed</em>.
		</p>
		<h5> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Sturgeon" target="_blank">Theodore Sturgeon</a> </h5>
		<p>
			Especially his short stories and the two novels <em class="BookTitle">
				Venus Plus X</em> and <em class="BookTitle">
				Godbody</em>
		</p>
		<h5> <a href="https://hpmor.com" target="_blank">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a> </h5>
		<p>
			Yudkowsky's <em class="BookTitle"> Harry Potter and
				the Methods of Rationality</em> is the best work of
				fiction I've read in at least ten years.  It made me
				examine all of my understanding of science, logic
				and more while simultaneously being vastly
				entertaining.  It's based on the premise that the
				seemingly impossible world of
				J.K. Rowling's <em>Harry Potter</em> books is real,
				only Yudkowsky takes it seriously as a scientist
				would.  Rowling's books are designed to teach
				children how to read, Yudkowsky's book is designed
				to teach you how to <em>think</em>!  Highly
				Recommended, and it's free on-line!  (I recommend
				downloading the epub or mobi version for easy
				reading on your favorite device - I read it on my
				phone.)
