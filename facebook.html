				<h2> Summary </h2>
				<p>
					This is the information you need to know if you
					want to Follow Me, Friend Me or Recommend that I
					Friend Someone on Facebook.  This all used to be
					written up very nicely in my Publicly Readable
					Facebook Profile until Facebook decided to simply
					trash all my content to prove who really runs the
					show!
				</p>
				<p>
					If you're already one of my Facebook Friends, I'd
					love it if you looked
					at <a href=https://touchpuuhonua.github.io/
					target="_blank">my website</a>
					especially <a href=https://touchpuuhonua.github.io/interests.html"
					target="_blank">my interests &amp; passions</a>
					and let me know more about your interests &amp;
					passions and which ones we share!
				</p>
				<h2> Real Community </h2>
				<p>
					My Real Community consists of people who I interact
					with regularly in the Real World and/or people who
					share
					my <a href=https://touchpuuhonua.github.io/interests.html" target="_blank">Interests
						and Passions</a>.  I use Facebook to enhance
					communication and continuity with this large
					community.  Although Facebook helps with this it is
					a challenge to have so many Facebook friends!  If
					you are not in my Real Community I will
					probably <em>not</em> accept your friend request.
				</p>
			</div> <!-- "community" -->
			<div id="identities">
				<h2> I have two Identities on Facebook </h2>
				<p>
					Although I have two personas, my nickname is simply
					<em>Touch</em>.  I happily and spiritedly welcome
					critical as well as supportive comments on my
					posts.
				</p>
				<p>
					If your post is critical there should be a clear intent to
					add value and the burden is <em>on you</em> to provide
					citations if appropriate.  If it ever seems
					that <em>my</em> criticism is <em>not</em> respectful and
					constructive you should consider it likely that you're
					being thin-skinned but you might private message me about
					it and I'll take your reaction seriously.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you act like a
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29" target="_blank">troll</a>
					I am likely to unfriend you.

				<h3> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hearttouch.puuhonua" target="_blank">Heart-Touch Puuhonua</a></h3>
				<p>
					Heart-Touch is my primary Social Persona.  I post
					about anything which I think might be of interest to
					or importance for my community.
				</p>
				<p>
					My likes and comments on my friend's posts
					are as much about expressing love and
					relationship as much as they are about any
					literal content.  I often limit my posts to
					friends-of-friends.
				</p>
				<p>
					My posts and comments range from silly to sympathetic
					to serious as I see fit.  I try to avoid posting too
					often, especially on the same subject and especially
					on political issues.  I try to avoid posting highly
					intellectual or technical posts or comments - that's
					what Head-Touch is for.
				</p>
				</div> <!-- "hearttouch" -->
				<div id="headtouch">		
					<h3> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/headtouch.puuhonua" target="_blank">Head-Touch Puuhonua</a></h3>
					<p>
						Head-Touch is my "Geek" Persona.  Follow or maybe
						Friend this account if you like relatively long and
						serious threads on intellectual and especially
						scientific and technological topics.  Some political
						and social posts will appear here if I'm viewing them
						from a Geek perspective.  Most Head-Touch posts are
						public.
					</p>
					<p>
						Following or friending Head-Touch is not recommended
						if you don't enjoy serious thinking!

				  <h2>Would you like to friend me?</h2>
          <!-- <a target="_blank" href="http://puuhonua.org/contact-touch.html" target="_blank">Contact Me First!</a> -->
				<p>
					I have
					much more trouble than most people remembering names
					and faces: <em>really!</em>  This is likely related to
					my being on the Autistic Spectrum, a condition which
					comes with both blessings and curses.  Even if you're
					someone I've met several times it is likely that I
					won't remember you without your reminding me of the
					circumstances:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li> Where was it?</li>
					<li>What did we talk about?</li>
					<li>What was important to you about our interaction?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					  If you'd like to friend me, please either Facebook Message Me or
send me a message via github
            <!-- use my <a target="_blank" href="http://puuhonua.org/contact-touch.html" target="_blank">contact form</a> -->
            and either way be sure to let me know</p>
				<ul>
					<li> how we know one another</li>
					<li> your Facebook URL or Account Name </li>
					<li> and perhaps some of our shared <a href=https://touchpuuhonua.github.io/interests.html" target="_blank">Interests and Passions</a></li>
				</ul>
			</div> <!-- "friending" -->
			<div id="introductions">
				<h2> Want me to friend someone? Introduce us!</h2>
				<p>
					If you want me to friend someone, <em>do not</em>
					recommend them through Facebook, I will ignore it!
					Instead, use Facebook messaging to send
					a <em>single</em> message addressed to <em>both of
						us</em> which introduces us as you would do in
					person and let us know why you think we should be
					friends.  We can then have a conversation and decide
					whether we want to friend one another.  I might ask
					them to read this webpage!

				   <h2> How to contact me </h2>
				   <p> Either send me a Facebook Message or use my handy
					 <a target="_blank" href="http://puuhonua.org/contact-touch.html" target="_blank">
					 Contact Page
					 </a>
					 If you use my Contact Page, please be sure and let
					 me know your Facebook Handle, perhaps by including
					 the url of your Facebook Account?
