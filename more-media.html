I rarely take the time to comment on fiction but some of it has made a
huge impact on my life.  I mention some works and many of my favorite
authors in my

				<dd>
					<span class="BookAuthor">Stephen
					Pinker</span></books:book> is on my short list of
					authors so good I'm inclined to read everything
					they write that is not too specialized.  At almost
					700 pages, <em class="BookTitle">The Better Angels
					of our Nature</em> seemed a bit daunting!  I'm
					about 2/3 of the way through now and finding the
					experience very worthwhile.  Most of the book so
					far has been about the extraordinary and ongoing
					decline in all forms of violence in all cultures
					over time, especially since the various 18th
					Century Enlightenments began to change all human
					cultures.  The facts and figures leave no doubt
					that this excellent good news is real.  The only
					speculative part of the book is the attempts to
					address <em>why</em> violence has declined so much
					and whether it will continue to do so in the
					future.  If you'd like to get a taste of the
					general arguments in the book, try this

	  I've just finished re-reading <em class="BookTitle">Nonzero</em>.  Robert
	  Heinlein once defined a good book as one which you can read
	  again and get more out of it, and a great book as one which
	  you can read again and again and keep getting more out of
	  it.  <em class="BookTitle">Nonzero</em> is definitely in the great category.
	  A conversation I was having recently with John Smart of the
	  <a>Acceleration Studies
	  Foundation</a> reminded me of <em class="BookTitle">Nonzero</em> and made it
	  clear to me that a re-read was in order.  In
	  <em class="BookTitle">Nonzero</em>, Robert Wright brilliantly applies game
	  theory to the evolution of life and human culture and makes
	  an excellent case for the continuous expansion of
	  non-zero-sum games in both arenas, giving a strong direction
	  of progressive change in both.  The book is much deeper and
	  broader than that simple sentence implies, and I consider
	  the book a must read for anyone who is interested in the
	  nature of being human.

	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_to_Reality" target="_blank">The Road to Reality : A Complete Guide to the Laws of the
			Universe</a>
	</em><span class="BookAuthor"> by  Roger Penrose</span></books:book></dt>
<dd class="BookComments">
<p>
	  Roger Penrose is my favorite physicist and my favorite
	  writer on Physics.  He explores physics at the ultimate
	  level, using models that <em>generate</em> spacetime, rather
	  than occur within it!  He is also an inventor, and some of
	  his earlier work inspired the artist Escher.  He is also an
	  unrepentent Platonist, i.e., he references a non-physical
	  timeless domain in which abstraction, including mathematics,
	  lives.  Many of the best mathematicians and mathematical
	  physicists are (or have been) Platonists, but it is not
	  fashionable to admit it.
	</p>
<p>
	In his earlier book <em class="BookTitle"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Mind" target="_blank">The Emperor's New Mind</a></em>, Penrose
	  wanted to talk about some unusual thoughts of his about how
	  human consciousness might be a quantum phenomenon, but in
	  order to explain it, he had to bring the reader up to his
	  level in the relevant mathematics and physics 
      &mdash;
    
	  and he did!  It is ironic that his theory of a quantum basis for
	  consciousness is rather lame but the book is absolutely
	  priceless for the lessons which constitute the bulk of it.
	</p>
<p>
	  Given all of the above, when I heard Penrose discussing his
	  new book <em class="BookTitle">The Road to Reality : A Complete Guide to the
	    Laws of the Universe</em> on NPR I bought it immediately and
	  started reading.  It is exactly what it says it is, but I'm
	  not as happy with it as I was with <em class="BookTitle">The Emperor's New
	    Mind</em>.  Most of both books consist of giving the reader
	  the necessary background to understand the later material.
	  In <em class="BookTitle">The Road to Reality</em> this material seems hurried
	  and incomplete.  In particular, his coverage of complex
	  analysis, which he makes clear is key, seems more like a
	  tease.  As a result, I've set the book aside for awhile and
	  I'm reading other material on complex analysis.  Why am I
	  willing to work so hard?  Because it really is <em class="BookTitle">A
	    Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe</em>, no fooling!
	  If it takes me a year to read it, or more; if I have to read
	  it more than once, it's worth it.  What I'd really like to
	  do is read it with others, so we can support one another in
	  really understanding it.

	  Richard Dawkins has been on my <em>read every non-professional

	    Selfish Gene</em>.  This book is very different from his
	  earlier works, as it covers all forms of life that are or ever
	  have existed on this planet!  This book is perforce long and
	  sometimes a bit dry.  It's also completely fascinating.  He
	  takes the unusual approach of starting with our own species
	  and then goes back in time following our earlier and earlier
	  common ancestors with related species and then larger and
	  larger related groups of living organisms.  Right now I'm
	  about halfway back to the beginning.

				Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer Programming</a>
	</em><span class="BookAuthor"> by Peter Van Roy and Seif Haridi</span></books:book></dt>
<dd class="BookComments"><p>
	  I love computer programming and all of the books and languages
	  I've used up until recently have been severely limited in
	  their approaches.  This is the first book to cover most of the
	  major computer programming models and it uses one of the best
	  programming environments (Mozart/Oz) for its examples.  I'm
	  having a blast reading the book and doing the exercises.  Soon
	  I'll need to come up with some really challenging projects to
	  exploit the power of Mozart/Oz.  The only flaw in my mind is
	  the bias against lexical typing.  If you're seriously
	  interested in computer programming, this one is a must read.

<dd class="BookComments"><p>
	  So why read this if the one above is so good?  C++ is the most
	  efficient general-purpose portable computer programming
	  language available.  Type-based (template) metaprogramming is
	  one of the most powerful programming technologies available.
	  Its also highly mind-expanding.  If you're a true geek and you
	  have a strong background in C++ this is for you.  A good
		prerequisite would be reading Bjarne Stroustrup's <em class="BookTitle">
			<a href="http://www.stroustrup.com/3rd.html" target="_blank">
				The C++ Programming Language</a></em> and then doing some significant
		C++ programming, including creating some handy template functions and classes.
		Don't even consider this as a beginner's book!
