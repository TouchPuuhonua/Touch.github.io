    <h1>Getting Ahold of Touch</h1>
		
		<p>
			Sometimes I'm hard to get ahold of &mdash; <i>really!</i>
			When I'm intently focused on a project or when I'm
			close to overwhelm I literally don't notice my phone
			alerts, I have no sense of the passage of time, what
			day it is, etc.  And despite this <b>I really want to
			hear from you</b> <i>and right away if we had an
			agreement to be in communication.</i>  What follows
			are some tips for getting or being in communication
			with me.  Let me know if these are not sufficient
			and/or if you have suggestions for me and/or need to
			communicate your frustration about this matter!
		</p>

		<h2> Urgent or time-sensitive short messages</h2>
		<ul>
			<li> <b>Text</b> <i> &mdash; especially if it's really short and simple</i></li>
			<li> <b>Phone Call</b><i> &mdash; especially if  I haven't replied to your urgent text</i>
				<ul>
					<li> repeat until you get ahold of me!</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2> Non-urgent short messages</h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Start by texting me </li>
			<li>	If it's regular, e.g. multiple times a week, shift to WhatsApp </li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>	Long messages</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>	Send as EMail or WhatsApp <i>(medium)</i></li>
			<li> If this is not part of an ongoing conversation:
				<ul>
					<li>	Text me that you just sent me a long message via <i>medium</i></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2> Even Better? </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>	I prefer Signal texts to SMS texts if you're on Signal</li>
			<li> I like videoconferencing with Zoom</li>
			<li> If you're friends with Head-Touch on FB
				<ul>
					<li>Messages go to my phone</li>
					<li>	 Great for important or time-sensitive messages </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
