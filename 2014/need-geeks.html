<div class="cols" >

<h2 id="whomightyoube">Who might you be?</h2>

<p>Are you (or someone you know) someone who loves learning the
latest software technologies and applying those technologies
to solving important human problems? Are you someone who
has some spare time or might create some if the project was
hot enough? Are you looking for something to take you in
new directions?</p>

<p>I have indeed some cool technologies and hot projects to
tempt you with. I can only accommodate A Few Good Geeks at
this time, so if you&#8217;re potentially interested, let&#8217;s talk
right away! If you know of someone who might be suitable,
please pass this invitation along.</p>

<h2 id="whatsinitforyou">What&#8217;s in it for you?</h2>

<p>This is NOT a job offer. I really am looking for a few
people who&#8217;d like to work on some projects in their spare
time.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s why you might be interested:</p>

<ul>
<li>The projects are designed to make a positive difference in the
world</li>
<li>Anyone who works on these projects is going to
increase both their skills and their reputation</li>
<li>The software is all open source so

<ul>
<li>you will wind up with a world-class toolkit</li>
<li>you can use that toolkit for your own projects</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Given the technology and the people:

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s going to be amazing fun!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="curiousaboutwhatprojects">Curious about what projects?</h2>

<p>We&#8217;re working on some closely-related projects<br />
using some cool technologies. The technologies include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Functional and Logical Languages, including

<ul>
<li>ClojureScript, Logic Programming, Advanced SQL</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Extensible Object Relational Database Systems supporting

<ul>
<li>SQL (and other) Metaprogramming</li>
<li>Multiple-Version Fork/Join Collaboration</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The projects involve a platform providing</p>

<ul>
<li>Augmentation of Intellect &amp; Collaborative Computing

<ul>
<li>Making Humans + Computers Smarter Together</li>
<li>Supporting better Human-Human Collaboration</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Facilitation of Self-Education and Collaborative Learning

<ul>
<li>Helping us learn anything which interests us</li>
<li>Including &#8220;hard&#8221; things like advanced mathematics</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Whether or not you already have experience with these
technologies, if you work with these projects you will
become an expert!</p>

<h2 id="whoami">Who am I?</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m a guy who wears a lot of hats:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m a Software Wizard, I cut my teeth on writing successful

<ul>
<li>Kernels, Compilers</li>
<li>Network &amp; Database Systems</li>
<li>Knowledge-Based Systems, i.e. AI Expert Systems</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I&#8217;m involved in some amazing Social and Learning Communities

<ul>
<li>Burning Man, The Human Awareness Institute and more</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I have a passion for Education

<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve trained thousands of engineers all over the world</li>
<li>I especially love facilitating project-based learning!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I also have a Professional Web Page which I keep separate
from my Page for Friends.</p>

<p>Here are some articles I wrote a few years ago at the beginning
of these projects. They give a flavor of the technology. Since
then a lot has been accomplished:</p>
