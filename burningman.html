    <h1>Touch on Burning Man</h1>

		<p>
					<em>Burning Man</em> began as a festival in San Francisco
					and is now a network of local communities spanning the
					globe.  In addition to the huge annual Festival which has
					moved to Navada's Black Rock Desert there are scores of
					other large gatherings and <em>of greatest importance</em>:
						unlimited opportunities to participate in <em>Burning Man</em>
						culture every day.
		</p>
		<p>In my region of San Diego County we
					hold one or two large gatherings a year of more than 1000
			people.  Local <em>Burning Man</em> participants create multiple local community
					events every week of the year.  Nearly all events are open to anyone
			interested in participating.  Perhaps of even greater importance, people in
			the Burning Man culture have an expanded level of participantion in the general
			political and cultural life of our region.  I expect that this is true of all local
			<em>Burning Man</em> participants and communities worldwide.
		</p>
		<p> The best way to learn about the <em>Burning Man</em> culture and
			community is to attend some of the gatherings and spend some times with the community.
