    <h1>A New Culture Manifesto </h1>

		<p>
			Let us say that Old Cultures are the cultures we have
			inherited and New Cultures are the cultures which we
			are consciously creating for ourselves, our
			communities and all of humanity.  Cultures consist of
			cultural content and are structured by contextual
			paradigms which need to be distinguished before we can
			engage with them consciously.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cultures exist along many dimensions, including
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Economic </li>
			<li> Psychological/Spiritual </li>
			<li> Social/Political </li>
			<li> Physical/Scientific/Technological </li>
			<li> Philosophical/Mathematical </li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Acting as individuals we have little power to shape
			and impact culture, as we are unable to engage with
			culture along enough dimensions.  Cultures are best
			enaged with by groups and communities with high
			levels of
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Awareness </li>
			<li> Diversity</li>
			<li> Partnership </li>
		</ul>
