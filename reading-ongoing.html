				Good coverage of anything really important, anywhere.

		<dl>
			<dt> <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com" target="_blank">Science Daily</a></dt>
			<dd>
				A comprehensive but highly dumbed-down overview of
				new scientific information.  You'll need to get
				closer to the source for anything interesting
				here.

				The single best in-depth coverage of the world. They're
				conservative - but by British standards (Whig).  I
				subscribed to their print edition for decades and now I read
				them on-line.

				I subscribed to their print edition, <em>World Press
					Review</em> for decades and now I read them on-line.
				They translate a cross-section of world news into
				English, including all regions and political
				viewpoints.  They are owned by a Foundation with a
				commitment to objectivity.

				Yes, they're not as technical as they used to be. They're
				still pretty good.  They do have a wierd prejudice against
				nano-technology - what's up with that?
