			<h2> The Dream of Augmented Intellect </h2>
			<p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart">
Douglas Engelbart
</a>
is one of the greatest of the early computer pioneers. He was one
of the first to realize that with a good human-computer interface a
human and a computer together can be much smarter than either are alone.  He
also realized that when you network the computers you have the potential to make
a group of people collectively smarter, capable of solving challenging problems
beyond the reach of unaugmented groups of human beings.
Doug Engelbart realized that this was
important, this was something which the world needed desperately.
Unfortunately, it was the 1950s and people were only using computers in
isolation as glorified calculators.  He found a few people who could understand
his vision and proceeded to invent the mouse, hypertext, networked computers
and a precursor of today's Graphical User Interface.
</p>
<p>
Doug Engelbart succeeded in all of his goals, but it was too early for his
inventions to change the world.  Computers were too expensive, computer
networks were in their infancy.  By the time technology was ready, people had
mostly forgotten what had been done, the computers and software platforms his
system was built on were no longer available and the work was tied up in intellectual
property restrictions.  As a result, today's computer
systems fall far short of the practical capabilities Doug Engelbart and his
team created 50 years ago.  The project I'm proposing here is the updating and
fulfillment of Doug Engelbart's work.  You might want to read more about him,
starting with
<a target="_blank" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart">
Wikipedia</a>, as background for my proposal.  By the way, Doug Engelbart
called his
vision <a target="_blank" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Intelligence_amplification">Augmentation
of Intellect</a>, and he called the system he created
<a target="_blank" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/NLS_%28computer_system%29">
Augment
(officially NLS)</a>.
I'll refer to his system
as <em>Early Augment</em> and his team as the <em>Early Augment Team</em>.

			<h2> Pulling Ourselves Up By Our Bootstraps </h2>
			<p>
How do you go about building a set of computer software tools which
make you and your colleagues smarter?  Doug Engelbart figured that out too.
You use a technique called
<a target="_blank" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Bootstrapping">
Bootstrapping</a>, otherwise known as <em>recursive self-improvement</em>.
It works like this: Working with a team, you find, adapt and/or create an initial
set of tools which augment your ability to create software toolsets for
augmented intellect, i.e. which increase your ability to do this kind of work.
Using this new set of tools, you do it again, but more easily, creating a
newer, better toolset.   As you and your team continue in this fashion,
refining and upgrading your augmented intellect toolset for the construction of
augmented intellect toolsets you find yourself getting smarter, more
capable.  Team communication and coordination become better,
more effective.  Challenging problems are solved faster, with less drudgery
and more fun.  And despite the fact that the official focus of your toolset
is on improving the toolset, you discover that you can solve all kinds of
other problems with the same kit.  In the bootstrapping metaphor,
you and your team have been pulling yourselves up by your bootstraps
and now you're flying!

			<h2> The Hard Work Has Already Been Done </h2>
			<p>
Unlike Doug Engelbart's situation in the 1950's and 1960's, computers
of enormous power are readily available and affordable.  Desktops, tablets and
smart-phones all have powerful graphical user interfaces.  Everything is
connected to the high-speed worldwide Internet - the network of all networks.
These systems have more than enough raw power and capacity to run
<em>Augment</em> software.  No hardware development is required.
			</p>
			<p>
Also unlike Doug Engelbart's situation, we now have very productive operating
systems along with extensive and capable libraries of software able to solve most of
the really difficult algorithmic problems that the <em>Early Augment Team</em>
had to solve.  In fact, we have
<a target="_blank" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software">Free/Libre
Open Source</a> solutions to most of the <em>Early Augment</em> problems.
Building a powerful <em>Augment</em> toolkit today is more a matter of sifting
out the needed components and composing them properly than it is a matter of
wholesale invention and development.

			<h2> The Enemies of <em>Augment</em> </h2>
			<p>
Many computer software systems today are better than anything which has gone
before, yet I also claim that a number of systems in the
past were <em>much</em> better than anything that exists today.  This has been
well documented by <a target="_blank" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Alan_Kay"> Alan Kay</a>, another great computer pioneer.  Alan is the guy
who conceived the Personal Computer and invented it with his team at Xerox
PARC in the 1970's.   At some point I intend to write up my experiences with
some of the earlier great systems, but in the meantime I'll point you to Alan
and ask that you believe your Elders here! [that's a joke]
<p>
OK, so <em>Why aren't our modern systems better at individual and collaborative
<em>Augmentation of Intellect</em> than systems of the past?</em>  How could
they possibly be worse?  They should actually be much better!
It turns out that although the raw capacity of a computer system
is very helpful in solving problems, it is no match for the <em>Enemies
of <em>Augment</em></em>.  Some of the key enemies are
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Unnecessary Complexity </li>
				<li> Lack of <a target="_blank" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Composability">Composability</a> </li>
				<li> Lack of <a target="_blank" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Meta-programming">Meta-Programmability</a>  </li>
				<li> Dumbing Down of the <a target="_blank" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/History_of_the_graphical_user_interface">Human-Computer Interface</a> </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
I will describe these enemies further in another document.
Once you realize the nature of these <em>Enemies
of <em>Augment</em></em> you will see that they
can all be overcome.  That's what this modern <em>Bootstrapping Augment</em>
project is all about.

			<h2> The Nature of the Work </h2>
			<p>
What will it be like working on this particular <em>Augment</em>
project?  Here are some of the qualities which I anticipate:
			</p>
			<p>
The work will begin by collecting together a set of core software,
intellectual and philosophical tools to create the initial toolkit.
Those who have experience with the necessarily technologies will
be available as leaders, facilitators and/or mentors to assist the
whole team becoming adept with the initial toolkit.  Some of the
key initial software is still under construction e.g. the <em>Wicci
Framework</em> and team members with the right skills and
interests will assist in quickly completing that.  Using the initial
toolkit we will build some collaborative systems which are better
in some important respects than what exists anywhere else in the
world.
			</p>
			<p>
The initial team will need to be fairly small, under 20 people, and most
of them will initially need to live in San Diego County.  As the collaborative
tools become available it will be possible to include a larger number
of people and a more geographically dispersed network of people.  Initially
the team will mostly be focused on a few short-term goals.  Later the
network of <em>Augment</em> users will be working on wildly
diverse projects - many of which are quite unforeseeable now.
			</p>
			<p>
The initial work will involve working directly with some low level languages,
paradigms and processes.  These include <em>shell scripting</em>,
<em>low-level procedural coding</em>, <em>SQL</em>, <em>HTML</em>,
<em>CSS</em> and <em>JavaScript</em> with most of the work being done
with <em>text editors</em>.  A lot of early work will
involve <em>debugging</em> and <em>unit testing</em>.  Later, much of this work
will move to
<em>high level declarative code</em> living in collaborative
<em>Wicci code stores</em> mostly managed by smart tools.
How soon will things get better?
As <a target="_blank" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Richard_Stallman">
Richard Stallman </a> likes to say:
<em>Sooner, if you help!</em>  My hope is that we'll see major improvements within
a few months.  I expect that the pace of improvement will follow an
exponential growth curve - by design.
