		<h1>Books and Other Media That Have Changed My Life</h1>
		
		<div class="cols">
      <p>
				I'm very interested in Media which significantly
				change the quality of my life by engaging with them.
				Books usually have the most impact for me, coming
				close to what is possible with immersive
				environments which I cover elsewhere.  I cannot
				imagine my life without the contributions made by
				these Media.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you like these Books and other Media or are inspired to
				read them soon, I'd love to share our experience of them.
				In the case of the books that are especially deep or are
				best read over a period of time, I'd love to have regular
				conversations with you while you read them and it might
				inspire me to read them again.  The same goes for my
				other <a href="reading-recommended-top.html"

				<dd>
					This extraordinary book provides a simple and
					compelling model for relating to one another
					with integrity, respect, authenticity and power
					without force.  The focus is first on relating
					within families and it also includes relating in
					business and among people in general.  It is a
					fictionalized condensation of the work of the
					Arbinger Instittute's workshops with troubled
					families.  I <b>highly</b> recommend this book!
					If you want a taste of the book, watch this video:

					This book lays out our tendency to thoughtlessly

				<dd>
					<span class="BookAuthor">Stephen
						Pinker</span> is on my short list of
					authors so good I'm inclined to read everything
					they write that is not too specialized.  At almost
					700 pages, <em class="BookTitle">The Better Angels
						of our Nature</em> seemed a bit daunting!  I'm
					about 2/3 of the way through now and finding the
					experience very worthwhile.  Most of the book so
					far has been about the extraordinary and ongoing
					decline in all forms of violence in all cultures
					over time, especially since the various 18th
					Century Enlightenments began to change all human
					cultures.  The facts and figures leave no doubt
					that this excellent good news is real.  The only
					speculative part of the book is the attempts to
					address <em>why</em> violence has declined so much
					and whether it will continue to do so in the
					future.  If you'd like to get a taste of the
					general arguments in the book, try this

				<dd>
					<em class="BookTitle">The Beginning of

					Knowledge, the Universe and Human Being's Place in
					it.  As <span class="BookAuthor">David
						Deutsch</span> is one of the smartest human beings
					on the planet and a noted out-of-the-box thinker,
					this inquiry goes extraordinarily deep and into
					unexpected places.  It has permanently altered how
					I view and think about who we are as human beings
					in the Universe.	If you want a taste of the book, watch his TED talk:

							The Logic of Human Destiny</a></em><span class="BookAuthor"> by Robert
						Wright</span></dt>
				<dd class="BookComments"><p>
						I've just finished re-reading <em class="BookTitle">Nonzero</em>.  Robert
						Heinlein once defined a good book as one which you can read
						again and get more out of it, and a great book as one which
						you can read again and again and keep getting more out of
						it.  <em class="BookTitle">Nonzero</em> is definitely in the great category.
						A conversation I was having recently with John Smart of the
						<a>Acceleration Studies
							Foundation</a> reminded me of <em class="BookTitle">Nonzero</em> and made it
						clear to me that a re-read was in order.  In
						<em class="BookTitle">Nonzero</em>, Robert Wright brilliantly applies game
						theory to the evolution of life and human culture and makes
						an excellent case for the continuous expansion of
						non-zero-sum games in both arenas, giving a strong direction
						of progressive change in both.  The book is much deeper and
						broader than that simple sentence implies, and I consider
						the book a must read for anyone who is interested in the
						nature of being human.

				These are books best read as part of a study group,
				I think.  Ideally with access to an expert mentor
				and/or someone who's recently studied them.  Let me
				know if you'd like to pursue that journey!

					</em> by <span class="BookAuthor">Leo Dorst</span>, <span class="BookAuthor">Daniel Fontune</span> and <span class="BookAuthor">Stephen Mann</span></dt>
				<dd class="BookComments"><p> I've been wanting to study <a href="http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/~clifford/pages/introduction.htm" target="_blank">Geometric
							Albebra</a> for ages because it make much of Physics and other areas
						of science <em>much</em> more accessible - it looks like one of
						the best mathematical systems ever developed for understanding the
						Universe.  However, it's hard (at least for me) to learn deep new
						areas of mathematics for myself.  I was delighted by the
						appearance of this new book because it allows me to explore
						Geometric Algebra in a more familiar and tractable context,
						Computer Graphics, along with software tools which can render the
						objects which have been constructed.  I still expect that reading
						through this will be a challenging (and exciting) journey and
						would love companions if you're interested.

							Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer Programming</a>
					</em><span class="BookAuthor"> by Peter Van Roy and Seif Haridi</span></dt>
				<dd class="BookComments"><p>
						I love computer programming and all of the books and languages
						I've used up until recently have been severely limited in
						their approaches.  This is the first book to cover most of the
						major computer programming models and it uses one of the best
						programming environments (Mozart/Oz) for its examples.  I'm
						having a blast reading the book and doing the exercises.  Soon
						I'll need to come up with some really challenging projects to
						exploit the power of Mozart/Oz.  The only flaw in my mind is
						the bias against lexical typing.  If you're seriously
						interested in computer programming, this one is a must read.
