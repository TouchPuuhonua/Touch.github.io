    <h1>Separate identities protect your Internet privacy</h1>

    <p>
 	This document is a <em>first draft</em> of an article on
	a complex topic.  It has not yet been
	reviewed by internet privacy experts.  Take it for what you
	can get from it and consider doing further research.  I'd
	love any feedback on how to improve it.
     </p>

    <div class="cols">

    <h2> How much privacy is possible? </h2>
    <p>
	A clever online sleuth or social engineer
	can probably find your tax and bank account numbers,
	your age and sex, home address, telephone numbers,
        sexual interests and practices, etc.  Is there any point in being
        careful anymore?  Maybe yes!
    </p>

    <h2> You have an internet dossier! </h2>
    <p>
      There are now companies which specialize in preparing internet dossiers on
      prospective employees, tenants, etc.  They use automated tools to pull
      together information on you from social network sites, email and twitter
      archives, blogs, etc.  They also look at information available on your
      friends and correspondents and use that to infer information about you!
      When people know you personally, this information is fairly harmless.
      Unfortunately, a prospective  employer, etc. is increasingly likely to
      look at such a dossier <em>before</em> choosing whether or not to meet you.
    </p>

    <div>
    <h2>Controlling your internet dossier</h2>
    <p>
      It's a lot of work to deter a determined hacker,  but
      <em> you can largely control what's in your internet dossier </em>
      because of how they're prepared.  Here are some
      things you can do to control what gets in your internet dossier:
    </p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Create separate identities for different aspects of your life</li>
	  <li>Encrypt your private e-mail</li>
	  <li>Encrypt your phone conversations</li>
	  <li>Use a contact-form on a website</li>
	  <li>Avoid spyware on your computer, phone, etc. </li>
	</ol>
    <p>
      I hope to get a chance to cover all of these topics in a later version
      of this or other articles.  Right now I'm just going to write about the first piece.
    </p>

    <h3> Creating separate identities for different aspects of your life </h3>
    <p>
      Names, numbers, email addresses and other distinctive pieces of
      information about you can be used as a <em>primary key</em>.
      Primary keys  which you (or spyware) transmit over the internet
      can be used by others to gather together
      all of your associated personal information.  If however, you create
      separate identities for different aspects of your life and avoid using
      any primary key across different identities then you can keep different
      aspects of your life separate.
    </p>

    <h3> How many identities should you have? </h3>
    <p>
     Somewhere in the range of 2-5 identities will suffice for most people,
e.g.
	</p>
      <ol>
	<li> One or more professional identities </li>
	<li> One or more friends and family identities </li>
	<li> Identities associated with any controversial special interests  </li>
      </ol>
	<p>
The separation of your professional identity from your social identity is the
most important one for most people.  The number of identities you need
and are willing to maintain depends on you; however, the fewer identities you
have to manage the better.
    </p>

    <h3> An example with two identities </h3>
    <p>
      Suppose you simply want to separate your online professional identity from
      your online social identity.
    </p>

    <h4> What belongs in your professional identity </h4>
    <p>
	A good rule of thumb about what should be here is
	any information you would put in a resume.  This should be your
        only online identity to use your legal name.
	You should <em>not</em> include your age or birthday!
        Any email address, phone number, mailing address, etc. which
        you use for business purposes is then off-limits for use by any
	other identity.  You can use your business identity with job and
	business networking sites.
        Any pictures associated with your professional identity should be
	consistent with your intended professional image.
    </p>
    <p>
	<em> Your professional identity is not a false image of you! </em>
	It is a simplified image of you. appropriate for people who
	do not have a closer relationship with you.  It can still be
	lively, creative and consistent with your values.  You are the same
	person whether you are wearing a business suit or a bathing suit.
	When and where you wear which matters!
   </p>

    <h4> What belongs in your social identity </h4>
    <p>
	It's useful to have a nickname or handle which your friends
	can easily associate with you but strangers cannot.  You can
	use this as the basis of personal websites, email addresses,
	social networking account names, etc.  If a social networking
	site like <em>Facebook</em> asks for your
	full real name, give them your nickname instead.  If you really
	want to share your birthday, leave off or slightly alter the year.
    </p>
    <p>
	Pictures of you cannot be used as a primary key - computers
	are very poor at finding matches for people in photographs.
	Make sure that any online photos of you which your
	friends <em>tag</em> or otherwise identify are tagged with
	your nickname, not your real name.
    </p>

    <h4> Some friends know more than one of your identities </h4>
    <p>
	You want to gracefully let your friends know that you
	prefer to reduce the exposure of your private information
	on the internet.   You may want to ask them to read this
	article, especially the next section.
    </p>

  </div>

    <h2> Respect your friends' privacy! </h2>
    <p>
	When you mention someone in an email, blog, twitter
	or any other online medium <em>do not mix their primary keys!</em>
	For example, avoid using someone's real name outside of
	a strictly professional context.  Always check with someone before
	giving out any of their personal information - better
	yet, let them give out the information.
    </p>

    <h2> Honesty and Openness </h2>
    <p>
	It's generally safe to be open and honest with other people
	who are open and honest.  Being open and honest with
	strangers who might take advantage of you is foolish.
	Your friends will respect you for being cautious with your
	information and with theirs.
