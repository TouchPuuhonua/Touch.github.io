This is an introduction to my thoughts about realistic near-term
prospects for Human Immortality and Transcendence.  I and others have
written on these and related issues extensively elsewhere.  Here I'm
emphasising the theme of immortality.  This writing is divided into
these sections.

<h2> <a href="#top">  Basic Statement </a> </h2>
			<div class="cols">
				<p>
I view existence as a sentient being to be of prime importance and I
see Human sentience as extraordinary, precious and all too fragile.  I
see it as tragic that our awareness is so limited much of the time and
is cut short so quickly by biological death.  Accelerating
Technological Change may offer some options for significantly
extending human lifetime in the near future, i.e. soon enough for
human beings alive to benefit from it.

          <a href="#top"> Important issues to mention and not address further in <em>this</em> article </a>
			</h2>

			<div class="cols">
			<p>
At this point we can only speculate about the extent of sentience in
non-human beings, e.g. animals, extraterrestrial intelligences or
artificial intelligences.  I see value in further inquiry into
non-human sentience but I will not do so here.
			</p>
			
			<p>
The quality of our being, our consciousness in each moment, is more
important than the quantity of years we have.  A practice of being
present much or most of the time gives our life very great value,
whether or not it is especially long in years.  Without being very
present, an extended lifetime would bring little benefit.
			</p>
		
			<p>
Our development as conscious beings, adding distinctions, growing the
range, scope and power of our experience and expression of being is
also of prime importance.  Extending our lifetimes beyond our ability
to grow and develop would be of limited benefit.
			</p>
		
			<p>
Given a high quality of being present, of ongoing growth and
development and ongoing expression of and sharing of our experience of
being sentient with others, it would then be very wonderful to extend
our biological lifespans.  Quantity AND quality of life.

				<p>
At the biological level, we are already immortal.  Every cell in my
body is part of a continuous chain of existence since the beginning of
life on Earth.  Although that original cell has divided and divided
and divided, and although the vast majority of the descendent cells
have died, along the lines of descent leading to each of my cells,
there has not been a single fatality.  My biological body is somewhat
more than 3.5 billion years old, and so is yours and so are the bodies
of every other living thing of which we know.  Evolution has already
solved the problem of biological immortality.
				</p>
			
				<p>
With single-celled organisms (the vast majority of cellular life),
death by aging is not an issue, it does not occur.  With
multi-cellular life forms, there is an appearance of aging and death
but it is an illusion.  Multi-cellular organisms consist of a group of
cells which (generally and approximately) share the same DNA.
Therefore, if one of those cells is immortal it is biologically the
same as if they were all immortal.  Germ cells, egg and sperm cells
in familiar organisms, are immortal in the same sense that
single-celled organisms are.  Any one of our germ cells could
conceivably live on for another 3.5 billion years with undiminished,
even evolutionarily enhanced vitality,
				</p>
			
				<p>
The majority of our cells are called somatic cells.  Although they are
genetic clones of our germ cells, they express different parts of
their DNA in order to perform a support function.  Their function is
to support the survival and passing on of their genetic clones, the
germ cells.  Because of sexual recombination of germ cells in each
generation, any organism which is moderately successful in
reproduction is likely to have a vast number of descendants.
Therefore, if all we care about is immortality as a biological
organism, it is not a big problem, it is a done deal.  Nothing is lost
when a cell dies in order that an identical clone survives.
				</p>
			
				<p>
The phenomena of disability, aging and death are only meaningful when
we are addressing the experience of the life of the whole organism
that goes beyond its biological function.  Evolution treats the whole
organism as merely a temporary means to an end - if the germ line has
continued before the whole organism dies nothing is lost.  Evolution
does not register sentience except as it contributes to reproductive
success.  Sentience is a higher-order property of a large and highly
organized central nervous system.

			<h2>
<a href="#top">  There are many paths to extended life as a sentient being </a>
			</h2>

			<div class="cols">			
			<p>
The most obvious way to continue our lives as conscious sentient
beings is by extending the life of the whole biological organism which
is our substrate.  I'll address the distinction of substrate more
later, but for now, let's just take the obvious viewpoint that if our
body does not age then we will live longer as a sentient being.
			</p>
			
			<p>
The invention of the microscope and other technologies for examining
biological structure has revealed that our bodies are built of cells
and allowed us to discover that cells are a kind of machine we now
call a molecular-scale replicator.  Machines are physical systems
built out of components with a specific structure.  The nature of a
machine's components and structure gives all of the machine's
properties, including what we consider its function. Until recently
human created machines seemed to be very different from biological machines in
many ways.  This is no longer true.
			</p>
			
			<p>
We are rapidly acquiring the ability to modify the DNA of biological
organisms and even to design biological organisms from scratch.  Along
a parallel track, we are acquiring the ability to create more general
molecular machines which have a potential functional range much
greater than that which is available to biological organisms.  If
you're having trouble applying the word "machine" to living things, it
is because your concept of "machine" is out of date.  Some human-designed
machines made of precise molecular assemblies exist now more such machines are likely to be produced in vast numbers in a few years.
Structures at the molecular size-scale are popularly called
nano-structures.
			</p>
			
			<p>
I am assuming here that human technological capacities continue along
their exponential growth path for another few decades.  There are
physical limits to such growth imposed by, e.g. the size of atoms but
we are still comfortably far from those limits.  I will be
conservative here and ignore any potential technology which would
require a change in our understanding of physical law or require any
unpredictable or unlikely breakthroughs.  I am addressing the kind of
advances which go beyond today's technology but which are likely to be
considered ordinary in a few decades.
			</p>
			
			<p>
I must assume no global catastrophe stops our technological growth
over the next few decades.  Therefore, the reason any of the following
possibilities will not occur is because a better option is found first
and the possibility presented here becomes obsolete before it is
developed.  Any one of the possibilities listed here might scoop the
others.  And an unexpected breakthrough could easily scoop all of
them.  Despite my conservative assumptions, I find it very interesting
to look at just how radical our future is likely to be.

<h2> <a href="#top">  Hacking our biology for immortality </a> </h2>
			
		<div class="cols">			

			<p>
Since biological cells already have the capacity for immortality, it
is possible to create versions of multi-cellular organisms which are
immortal at the whole organism level, including immortal versions of
human beings.  This could be done over time through selective breeding
or very quickly using genetic engineering.  In addition to creating
immortal-from-birth humans, we could use gene "therapy" to give all
such advantages to existing human beings.
			</p>
			
			<p>
Reversing aging and any other desired repairing and upgrading of
existing humans is well within foreseeable engineering technology.  It
turns out that there is room in the human body to introduce extensive
therapeutic machinery.  Currently more than 90% of the cells within
our body are not <em>our</em> cells containing <em>our</em> DNA, they are symbiotic
organisms such as bacteria.  We could introduce lots more symbiotic
organisms and/or replace the existing ones without anyone knowing the
difference.  Symbiotic organisms and other nano-machines can be
designed to carry out any desired therapeutic function on human cells
and tissues in situ and ongoingly.
			</p>
			
			<p>
Even with extensive built-in immortality and healing, humans could
still die from catastrophic accidents.  Advanced biological
technology, nano-technology or a combination of the two can offer us
the ability to make backup copies of bodies, including all of the
subtle structures in our nervous system which store our memories and
personality.  These backups can be updated daily or even continuously
via, for example, built-in wireless Internet connections.  You would
never know that such backups were being made, unless or until you
suffered a catastrophic accident, e.g. falling into a volcano!  In
such a case, you would simply wake up a few moments later in a backup
body, none the worse for the experience.
			</p>
			
			<p>
Merely extending life as we know it is not revolutionary.  Predictable
technological developments offer much more.

		<div class="cols">			
			<p>
We are more intelligent in many ways than the most powerful
computers or computer networks, and this will be true for some
time.  However, current computers are in many ways more
intelligent than us as well.  Current computers and humans
have very different cognitive limitations and are remarkably
complementary.  We don't currently know how to imbue computers
with true sentience, but a good interface between a human mind
and a computer system would produce a sentient being with
extraordinary capacities.  While we can imagine some of what
would be possible for such a being, the true range of its
consciousness and capacities go far beyond what we are able to
forsee given our vastly inferior minds.
			</p>
			
			<p>
Over the next few years computers are going to get much more powerful
and will be made of nano-structures at least as elegant as any
biological nano-structures.  This can be accomplished with reasonable
extrapolations of existing technologies.  Althrough vast computational and
logical capacity are not the same as intelligence or consciousness,
here are two different possible paths to transcendence: The AI Path
and the Symbiosis Path.
			</p>
			
			<p>
In the AI Path, we somehow develop an advanced computer system which
has all of the kinds of intelligence and insight which human beings
have.  it might or might not be conscious as well.  Since its raw
computational capacities go far beyond ours, such a system would seem
super-human.  Building such a system is <em>not</em> a mere
extrapolation of current knowledge, it would require fundamental
breakthroughs.  I know at least three approaches to building such a
system which seem promising, but I won't cover them here.
			</p>
			
			<p>
In the Symbiosis Path, we interface our minds to computer systems in
such a way that the computer system seems like part of our mind.  We
retain all of our qualities of conscious experience along with all of
our other human qualities but with a vast expansion of our perception,
discrimination, knowledge, awareness and overall intelligence.  Again
we have a super-human.  This path does not seem to require as manyf
undamental breakthroughs as the AI Path does and it could be accomplished
by modest incremental improvements over many years.
			</p>
			
			<p>
These two paths are not necessarily distinct.  A super-human AI system
would surely be able to create a Symbiosis Path super-human and a
coalition of Symbiosis Path super-humans would surely be able to
figure out how to create a super-human AI.  These two paths might
emerge together, or one might emerge first and quickly give rise to
the other.
			</p>
			
			<p>
A computer system can share any part of its "mind" over a network.
Computers have perfect "telepathy".  Human/computer symbiotic persons
would be able to share any parts of their minds with one another.
Eventually the distinction "individual" breaks down in such a world,
and the phenomenon of death no longer applies.  How can "I" die when
many versions of the parts of me I care about are distributed
throughout vast numbers of physical brains and cyber minds?
			</p>
			
			<p>
These scenarios (and many alternatives which I have not
addressed here) take us into a new world with sentient beings
possessing capacities far beyond ours.  Our problems are not
their problems.  Their problems - if they even think in terms
of problems - would likely be beyond our comprehension.
Although the path to such transcendent beings is entirely a
result of continuing the lines of development we are currently
on and involves no fundamental scientific breakthroughs, the
result is the creation of a new order of being(s) which we
cannot in principle comprehend.  This is the Technological
Singularity.

The rate of technological development continues to increase.  The
Technological Singularity is likely to happen in our lifetimes.  It
could happen within a few years, although I think a few decades more
likely.  A lot of very smart people have been thinking about and
discussing these issues for many years - what I've written here only
scratches the surface.  I recommend looking up "technological
singularity" in Wikipedia.org and Google.
