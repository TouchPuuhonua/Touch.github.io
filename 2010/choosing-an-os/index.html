      <p>
	The choices around modern computer systems are complex and confusing.
	My friends know that I am a fairly high-powered computer expert and
	often ask my advice.  I would like to assist my friends in making good
	choices around what computer systems to buy and how to use them in
	order to best meet their needs.  This is difficult because modern
	commercial computer systems are designed to only partially meet
	anyone's needs; instead they are designed to tease and ultimately
	frustrate us so that we are a good market for frequent upgrades which
	always promise to do better and always leave us wanting.
      </p>

    </div> <!-- h2 -->

    <div id="background" class="h2">

      <h2> <a href="#top">  Quick Background </a> </h2>

      <p>
	A computer system is a combination of computer hardware
	(electronic components) under the control of computer software
	(instructions telling the hardware how to behave).  Computers
	systems offer us unlimited possibilities: Some are obvious,
	some obscure and the greatest possibilities remain to be
	discovered.  In the early year this was well understood by
	practitioners.  We designed our operating systems to empower
	ourselves and all users as participants in a grand adventure.
	Some experts revel in complexity, but good designers see
	unnecessary complexity as a flaw and work to minimize
	complexity while maximizing power and the satisfaction of all
	users.  I was a designer and developer in those early years
	and I looked forward to a bright future as the state of our
	art improved.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	The future has not turned out as we hoped and expected!  The
	popular modern computer systems have standardized their
	hardware and software around some poor early design choices
	which reduce their usability and render them dangerously
	insecure.  Computer system vendors have learned that they can
	maximize their profits by limiting and controlling the ways in
	which we, their customers, can use our own systems.  Each new
	release advertises increased productivity and security
	while offering no real increase in power, no real protection
	from what external attackers can do with our systems while
	increasingly restricting what we ourselves can do.  Consider
	that many home computers connected to the Internet are now
	part of sophisticated bot-nets whose power is sold on black
	markets and is used for a variety of criminal purposes.  Can
	we, the legitimate users, with our glitzy Graphical User
	Interfaces (GUIs) do anything as creative and powerful as
	that?
      </p>
      
      <p>
	My intention here is not to explore how computer systems
	SHOULD be designed, nor to present the relatively obscure
	modern systems which are best.  I assume that most of my
	friends have a very limited tolerance for technical complexity
	and want a platform which lets them run popular applications,
	play all their media and have everything "just work".  The
	only real contenders for most users are Microsoft Windows,
	Apple Macintoshes and some Gnu/Linux distributions.
      </p>
	
      <p>
	Let me start with the bottom line: The best computer system for you
	depends on who you are and the nature of your friends and work
	environment.  But read on for some details.

	<h3> <a href="#top">  1. Apple Macintosh </a> </h3>

	<div class="h4">

	  <h4> Why less-technical users often prefer the Apple Macintosh</h4>

	  <p>
	    The Macintosh system comes closest to being a system which
	    "just works".  It's the easiest to use.  Everything feels
	    better designed.  There is a sense of quality and good
	    taste.  It's somewhat more secure against attack on the
	    Internet than the market leader, Microsoft Windows.
	  </p>

	  </div> <!-- h4 -->
	
	<div class="h4">

	  <h4> Why you might not like a Macintosh</h4>

	  <p>
	    1. If no one else in your community use Macs - i.e. none of your
	    friends or colleagues do, you may find yourself uncomfortably
	    isolated.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    2. Apple works hard to make their products control what
	    you can do with them.  What they want you to do will be
	    easy.  Anything else will be obscure or even, through DRM
	    (Digital Rights Management), impossible.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    3.  You can only use the Macintosh Operating System on an Apple
	    Macintosh computer.  Again, Apple insists on controlling all aspects
	    of your system.  Apple Macintosh computers use the same technology as
	    all other modern PCs, but they are more expensive up-front.
	  </p>
	  
	</div> <!-- h4 -->

	<div class="h4">

	  <h4> Why technical users often prefer the Apple Macintosh</h4>

	  <p>
	    The Macintosh operating system is built on top of a very
	    powerful system called BSD.  Although Apple carefully
	    hides BSD from regular users, power users can freely
	    download the rest of a BSD system, including an X Window
	    System and a Korn Shell to get a truly first-class
	    environment.

	<h3> <a href="#top">  2. Gnu/Linux </a> </h3>
	    
	<p>
	  The Free Software Foundation designed the Gnu Operating
	  System to be as open as possible.  They invented the concept
	  of <em>Free Software</em> and the "Gnu Public LIcense" which
	  guarantees the right of any user to
	  <ol>
	    <li> Use the software for any purpose.</li>
	    <li> Inspect how it works. </li>
	    <li> Modify it any way they like. </li>
	    <li> Redistribute it as long as the license is retained. </li>
	  </ol>
	  Although most individual users do not directly take
	  advantage of these options, the community as a
	  whole <em>does</em>, to everyone's benefit.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  The Gnu Operating System is most often used with something
	  called the Linux Kernel, a low-level part of the operating
	  system which users never see.  Many people use the
	  term <em>Linux</em> to refer to any complete operating
	  system which includes a Linux Kernel. The Free Software
	  Foundation requests that we use the term Gnu/Linux for any
	  complete system combining of Gnu and non-Gnu <em>Free
	  Software</em> components including the Linux Kernel.  I try
	  to honor their request, especially in writing.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  Gnu/Linux comes in many versions called "distributions".
	  Each distribution customizes Gnu/Linux for a certain kind of
	  computer system and particular usage.  At the large scale:
	  Most modern supercomputers (the most powerful computers
	  which exist) run Gnu/Linux as do most of the computers
	  called servers which provide most of the services on the
	  Internet.  At the small scale: Most new "smart phones" and
	  most embedded network devices are based on Gnu/Linux.
	  Commercial distributors try to rebrand Gnu/LInux as their
	  own and often avoid using either the term Gnu or Linux!
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  Your desktop, laptop or netbook is well served by distributions like
	  Ubuntu which balance ease of use with flexibility and power.
	</p>
	
	<div class="h4">

	  <h4> Why you might prefer Gnu/Linux</h4>
	  
	  <p>
	    A friendly Gnu/Linux distribution like Ubuntu or Mint does
	    everything which most computer users expect from a
	    computer system.  You can browse the web with Firefox,
	    edit documents with LibreOffice, OpenOffice or Google Docs, listen to
	    your music collection, watch DVDs, browse and retouch your
	    photographs, etc. The graphical interfaces are easy to use
	    and there are almost no limits on what you can do.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    Gnu/Linux is the most secure of modern popular computer systems and
	    the major distributions provide free security updates when flaws are
	    found.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    Gnu/Linux is designed to allow you the largest possible choice of how
	    your computer system behaves.  You can add to or replace any part of
	    the system from a collection of tens of thousands of components using
	    a sophisticated but easy-to-use packaging system which ensures the
	    integrity of the whole system.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    The Free Software License make it impossible for a company
	    to use Gnu/Linux software to limit what you can do with it
	    and because it is so open and well studied, security flaws
	    and limitations are generally found and fixed very
	    quickly.
	  </p>

	</div> <!-- h4 -->

	<div class="h4">

	  <h4> Why you might not like a Gnu/Linux system</h4>

	  <p>
	    1. If no one else in your community uses Gnu/Linux -
	    i.e. your friends colleagues, you may find yourself
	    uncomfortably isolated.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    2. If you want to play media encoded in patented and
	    restricted formats, you may find downloading the needed
	    codecs first to be bothersome, although the friendlier
	    Gnu/Linux systems make this pretty easy.  Some restricted
	    media, e.g. Blu-Ray, have no legal codecs for open
	    platforms like Gnu/Linux.  Although there are generally
	    workarounds for these problems, you may find them
	    bothersome.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    3. If Gnu/Linux does not have drivers for all of your
	    devices.  Many hardware vendors, for example NVidia and
	    Broadcom try to keep the design of their devices a secret.
	    Of course they provide drivers for Microsoft Windows, but
	    without the "source code" it is impossible to tell if those
	    device drivers have hidden flaws.  Microsoft attributes
	    most crashes of their operating system to flaws in these
	    device drivers.  Gnu/Linux developers have done an
	    extraordinary job of writing drivers which allow Gnu/Linux
	    to "just work" on most modern PCs, but not all features of
	    all devices will work.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    4. Some people are actually disturbed by all the choices
	    which Gnu/Linux offers.  Of course you can ignore all the
	    choices and just go with what a simple distribution
	    provides by default.
	  </p>
	  
	</div> <!-- h4 -->
	
	<div class="h4">
	  
	  <h4> Gnu/Linux Bottom line</h4>

	  <p>
	    Gnu/Linux is excellent and free, you can (and should)
	    check it out by booting from a "live CD" or USB thumbdrive
	    - this allows you to try it out on your computer without
	    installing it or othewise affecting your computer.  You
	    probably want to have friends who are familiar with
	    Gnu/Linux available for support until you're used to it.

	<h3> <a href="#top"> 3. Microsoft Windows </a> </h3>

	<div class="h4">

	  <h4> Why you might prefer Microsoft Windows</h4>

	  <p>
	    If it's what you're used to, if it's what "everybody else" seems to be
	    running, among your friends and at work.  As a (convicted) monopoly
	    controlling 90% of the desktop and laptop market, Microsoft's biggest
	    asset is its familiarity, it's so-called "mindshare".
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    Hardware manufacturers have to provide drivers for
	    Microsoft Windows if they want anyone to buy their
	    products, therefore nearly all PC devices mostly work.
	  </p>

	</div><!-- h4 -->
	
	<div class="h4">
	  
	  <h4> Why you might not like a Microsoft Windows system</h4>

	  <p>	    Microsoft systems are bloated and inefficient - they
	    require a more powerful CPU and more memory than Macintosh
	    or Gnu/Linux systems for equivalent performance.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    Unless you're already used to them, Microsoft's graphical
	    user interface is harder to learn and to use than the
	    other systems.  It has a clumsy and chaotic design,
	    especially when compared to the Apple Macintosh.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    Microsoft filesystems, e.g. FAT and NTFS and their document formats,
	    e.g. doc and xls are famously incompatible, not just with those of
	    other systems, but across different versions of Microsoft Windows and
	    Microsoft Office.  Documents stored in Microsoft formats may well be
	    unreadable a few years down the road.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    Microsoft Windows systems are inherently insecure on the Internet.
	    Microsoft came very late into the networking game.  Bill Gates
	    famously said "The Internet will never amount to anything".  They
	    designed their systems for small, completely controlled corporate
	    networks.  Microsoft systems tend to trust other systems on the
	    network and are therefore very easy to subvert.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    Microsoft and their products are easy (and fun) to criticize.
	    Microsoft outspends the rest of the industry on lobbying and
	    marketing.  Most of their products and divisions actually lose
	    money, but because of their dominant market position supplying
	    operating systems and office software for PCs they are (at the
	    time of this writing) the richest company in the industry.
	    Enough said!
	  </p>
	  
	  </div> <!-- h4 -->

	<div class="h4">
	
	  <h4> Can you use Microsoft Windows without getting into trouble?</h4>

	  <p>
	    Although it is impossible to secure an individual copy of Microsoft
	    Windows, there is in fact a way to use it securely.  An old mainframe
	    technology called "Virtualization" has recently become possible on
	    regular desktop and laptop computers.  Virtualization allows you to run an
	    unsafe operating system as a "guest" on top of a secure operating
	    system which serves as the "host".  The user of the computer only sees
	    the guest operating system.  When properly set up, the guest can be
	    replaced with a fresh copy after every backup.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    Virtualizing Microsoft Windows mitigates its security
	    problems.  Virtualization also allows you to move your
	    Microsoft Windows environment from one computer to another
	    without having to go through their registration process
	    each time.

	    None of these choices are perfect.  All of these systems

	    Check out all of your options.  I especially recommend
