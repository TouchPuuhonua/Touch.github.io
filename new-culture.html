    <h1>Touch on New Culture</h1>
		
		<p>
			There is no official definition of <em>New Culture</em> and in
			fact there can't be: <em>New Culture</em> is being co-created in
			communities all over the world.  It is an exploration of what is
			possible in expressing fundamental values and it is either alive
			and a work-in-progress or it is not <em>New Culture</em>!  This
			webpage presents some of my thoughts on <em>New Culture</em> and
			why it inspires me..

		<h2>Some terminology I like to use about culture</h2
<dl>
			<dt>Default Culture</dt>
		<dd>
I use the term <em>Default Culture</em> to refer to the common culture
we see on TV and on the street.  There are good and bad aspects
of <em>Default Culture</em>.  <em>Default Culture</em> is a simplified
lowest-common-denominator culture.  It is handy as a place where
people from differing cultural backgrounds can meet and everyone can
know the rules.  I first heard the term <em>Default Culture</em> used
in this way in the <em>Burning Man</em> Community and I liked it for
it's descriptive and non-judgemental character.
</dd>
 <dt>Old Culture</dt>
 <dd>
I use the term <em>Old Culture</em> to refer to the culture we inherit
from our family and community of origin.  <em>Old Culture</em> may be
similar to or quite different from <em>Default Culture</em> depending on
our individual circumstances.  As with <em>Default Culture</em>, we are
likely ambivalent about it and we probably hope for something better for the
future.  I distinguish <em>Old Culture</em> to contrast with how I distinguish
<em>New Culture</em>,
</dd>
 <dt>New Culture</dt>
 <dd>
I use the term <em>New Culture</em> to refer to the culture we are
engaged in creating, in solidarity with other creative people in our
community and in solidarity with the <em>New Culture</em> explorations
going on world-wide..
<em>New Culture</em> is not some future Utopia but an
ongoing creation which we test out by living it right now.
It is always a work-in-progress which we are co-creating.
Rather than trying to change the whole world according to a
conceptual ideal, <em>New Culture</em> aims to discover
better ways to live and organize community locally and then
allow those discoveries to diffuse outwards into the world.
As <em>New Culture</em> spreads and is adapted and remixed,
we get to receive as well as give away updated versions
of <em>New Culture</em> and allow the world to be transfomed
gradually from many sources.  If you think this vision is
unrealistic then I ask you: Where do you think <em>Old
Culture</em> came from?  I first encountered the
term <em>New Culture</em> used in this way when I attended
the extraordinary <a href="nfnc.org">Network for New
Culture</a> <em>Summer Camp</em> retreats.  Every since I
have been looking at every group and humanistic organization
with the question <em>How are they contributing to the
creation of New Culture?</em>.  And I'm asking the same
thing of myself!

<h2> Some Avenues to New Culture</h2>

<dl>
	<dt><a href="orgs-human.html">Organizations Empowering New Culture</a></dt>
	<dd>
		<p>
			I have had the privilege of participating with a
			number of organizations which offer programs which
			nourish and empower <em>New Culture</em>.  I have
			obtained enormous personal value from participating
			with the organisations and that value has impacted the
			quality of my whole community.

	<dd>
		<p>
			<em>Burning Man</em> began as a festival in San
			Francisco and is now a network of local communities
			spanning the globe.  In addition to the huge annual
			Festival which has moved to Navada's Black Rock Desert
			there are scores of other large gatherings.  In my
			region of San Diego County we hold one or two large
			gatherings a year of more than 1000 people, but more
			importantly we have several local community events
			going on every week of the year.  Burning Man
			participants are not
