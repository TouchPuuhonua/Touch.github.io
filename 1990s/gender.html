    <h1>Are You A Gender Criminal?</h1>
<p>
Are you guilty of gender transgressions?  As a child, a teen, a youth
and as a young adult, how did your family and community react to your
expression of masculinity or femininity?  What did you decide in
response to their reactions?
</p>
<p>
How was your gender expression policed?  Did you get corrected, teased
and put down?  Did you feel safe?  What about the subtle and indirect
messages?  Were you told that you need to <em>act like a
boy/girl/man/woman,</em> implying that you weren't doing so?  When did
you learn that part of the responsibility of being your sex was to
suppress behaviors associated with the <em>opposite</em> sex?  When did you
find out that there were people who failed to do so?  What were they
called, what are some of the names?  What happens to them?  Are they
loved and taken care of?  Are they even considered human?  How long
have you been afraid that you might be one of them?  Are you still
aware of that fear or is it pushed down deep?  Maybe it's turned into
something else, like an in-your-face attitude or wooden Republicanism.
</p>
<p>
How were others treated while you were watching?  What was said behind
their backs?  What were you willing to do to avoid being treated like
that?  Did you learn that you could pass more easily if you joined the
gender police?  If you agreed with the gossip, joined in the taunting?
How far did you go to pass?  Did you conclude you were OK because you
could pass, or did you simply feel like you were a deviant in
disguise?  If you failed to pass with the in-crowd, who did you hang
out with?  Did they let you be yourself or did you construct an act to
please them too?  How do you make yourself acceptable in your current
community?  What are you afraid to do/say/feel now?
</p>
<p>
In our established queer spaces are we free to express ourselves?  The
original Stonewall Inn was a hangout for nelly and <em>straight acting</em>
men, fem and stone butch dykes, fag hags, bohemian straights and drag
queens.  In the early gay liberation movement the word gay included
bisexual and transgendered people and lots of queer folk were happily
married with children.  Are you comfortable around all of these kinds
of people?  Are they made welcome in the bars you frequent, at the
meetings you attend at <em>The Center?</em>  Do you avoid some kinds of men
or women, because they act too [fill-in-the-blank]?  Are you afraid
it might be catching or do you admire those who express what you feel
you can't?
</p>
<p>
However you are being, you are always being yourself, and are
therefore always being appropriate to your sex.  It's time to reclaim
your right to explore your gender:
</p>
<p>
What are the elements of your gender expression?  How have you learned
to walk?  Move your hands?  Do you use your full vocal range or keep
your pitch and volume under control?  How do you dress?  What colors
and accessories are OK?  I think you'd look great in that pair of
chaps, that full skirt, that corset, that pirate shirt, that sailor
suit, that fabulous hat and those shoes -- are you afraid to try them on?
</p>
<p>
Who is it OK to lust after?  Who is it OK to be caught lusting after?
If you consider yourself gay or lesbian, is it OK to sometimes be
attracted to someone of another gender?  If you consider yourself
straight (yes, I know you read this newspaper too), is it OK to be
attracted to someone of your own gender?  If you consider yourself bi
do you question that?  Do you resist labels?  Why?  When you feel an
attraction that contradicts your identity what do you do?  How far
will you let yourself go?  Would it be OK to experiment?
</p>
<p>
Have you trained yourself to act <em>appropriately?</em>  How well do you
think you do?  Can you let go of the act?  Do your strategies leave
you with the freedom of a young child who's just being and expressing?
Could you exercise the freedom of a performance artist exploring and
adding more dimensions and richness to the expression of your gender?
How will you express yourself today?
